## Challenges and Lessons Learned

- **API Handling**: Learning how to handle Gemini API calls.

- **PDF Generation with Puppeteer**: I faced challenges in converting .md files to PDF. So i used an alternative method using Puppetter i first converted .md files to HTML and then used Puppeteer to generate a PDF.

- **File Handling Across Frontend and Backend**: I implemented efficient handling of file responses between the backend and frontend.
